# This .gitignore file is intended to provide a comprehensive list of commonly ignored objects in a Git repository. It helps to keep the repository clean and avoids tracking unnecessary files and directories.
# It also includes specific patterns for ignoring all files in a directory or ignoring a specific file in a directory.
# Feel free to modify this file based on your project's specific requirements by adding or removing patterns as needed.

# For more information on gitignore patterns, refer to:
